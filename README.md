# 🌟 My First GitHub Repository

> "My first GitHub repository to start learning and exploring."


## 🚀 Let's Begin!

Hi there!  
I'm excited to share that this is my very first GitHub repo. I'm using it to understand how GitHub works, try out small projects, and slowly improve my skills.


## 🧠 Why I Made This

- To learn how to use Git and GitHub  
- To keep my practice files in one place  
- To see my progress over time  
- To build something on my own


## 🙋‍♀ About Me

I'm Smruti Rekha Swain — just someone who's learning to code and figure things out step by step.  
I don’t know everything yet, but I’m excited to keep learning.


> Thanks for stopping by! 🙂
